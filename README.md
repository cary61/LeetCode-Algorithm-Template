# LeetCode-Algorithm-Templates
Algorithm templates that help to solve problems.

Copy the code and paste it down your solution, create an instance of data structure and use it.



If you need to learn how to use a data structure, go straight to its code and see the comments of every class and almost every method.

If you don't need to be told what to do, go get raw code without any comments in package "nocomments", it contains the same directory form of normal version.
