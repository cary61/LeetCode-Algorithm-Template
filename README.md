# Java-Algorithm-Templates
Algorithm templates that help to solve problems.

Copy the code and paste it down your solution, create an instance of data structure and use it.



If you need to learn how to use a data structure, go straight to "Standard"and see the comments of every class and almost every method.

If you don't need to be told what to do, go get raw code without any comments in "NoComments", it contains the same directory form of normal version.



Because this project aims to be copied and pasted, there is no package relations between the java files. Though at the top of each java file, there might be commented lines that indicate what java package this solution needs. In case of on some OI, you need to import them yourself.
